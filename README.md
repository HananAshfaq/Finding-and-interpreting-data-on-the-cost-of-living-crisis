# Finding-and-interpreting-data-on-the-cost-of-living-crisis
The scope of this research encompasses the analysis of fuel prices and their impact on the cost-of living crisis using various data science techniques based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI),GDP dataset and import export dataset by applying machine learning techniques such as Time series forecasting models(ARIMA,SARIMAX).

The core objective to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the impact of fuel prices
on the cost-of-living crisis.
- Data Extraction and Transformation: utilize the potential datasets by merging and
transforming them to yield actionable insights.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: dig into the data for identifying patterns, outliers, and potential
correlations among various variables related to this subject area.
- Statistical Analysis: utilize libraries like NumPy, and SciPy for robust statistical examinations to
examine the significance of different variables in impacting the cost-of-living for individuals.
- Time Series Forecasting: deploy Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and
Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average with exogenous variables (SARIMAX)
time series forecasting models to predict fuel price.
- Cluster Based Segmentation: Identify regional clusters based on fuel price variations using
elbow analysis, silhouette scores, and machine learning (ML) methodologies.
- Historic Trend Analysis: understand how fuel prices varied in other countries over time.
- Interactive Dashboarding: using Power BI for making interactive dashboards regarding our
findings
